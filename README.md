Main Problems Faced during handeling Null values :
column 'language' : we used the mode to impute null values but this is not good since english is the most frequent value but it is not necessary that the null language will be english it depends on other factors like book description , author , categories, publication place, imprint etc. , we need to predict the language but as of now, this is out of our scope.
